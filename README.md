# Advanced-Recursion-and-Graphs
This repository contains code for the challenges outlined in the [CS 2.2](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/CS-2.2-Advanced-Recursion-and-Graphs/) class at Make School.

## Graphs Implementations to Try
- Adjacency list (dictionary where keys are the name of vertex, and the value is an array of vertices it connects to; another option is an array of arrays using inner elements as other vertices in the outer array, the names can be stored in a dictionary)
- Adjacency matrix (array of arrays using items to indicate edges between a row and column index which indicate vertices)
- Incidence matrix (array or arrays where the rows are vertices and columns are edges)
- Node objects (for each vertex, and pointers to other vertices for each edge)

## Graph Features to Implement
- Directed and undirected edges
- Weighted and unweighted edges
- Breadth-first search and depth-first search

## Further Features to Implement
- Tests for all the methods
- Benchmarks for all the methods
- Readable print out of the graph structure

## Resources Used to Help Get Started
- [Wikipedia's graph page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28abstract_data_type%29)
- [Java's graph methods](https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/11119/jdev/api-reference-esdk/javax/ide/util/Graph.html)
